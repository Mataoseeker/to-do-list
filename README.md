## Creating a TO Do List  

[To DO] Created using React.


### Getting Started
- I created an input field and then the onChange functionality to track every input
- Added buttons for inputting the task as well as deleting the task
- Functionalities were then created to ensure that even if tasks of the same name is created, only one can be deleted.
- Styling was then added to give it a more unique outlook
